            <p>Hey there! üåç </p>
            <p>
              I'm Sesil. I am originally from Bulgaria and I've spent over three
              years living and studying in the vibrant city of Eindhoven,The
              Netherlands. I always knew that working on creating content gave
              me a big sense of purpose and connection to the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              What sets my work apart is the infusion of emotions into my design
              process. I find immense joy in inspiring others through my work,
              striving to make life a tad bit easier for everyone who interacts
              with what I create.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mission to make the connection of the physical and the digital
              world easy, entertaining and useful. ‚ú®

              I have a passion for creating content - posters, Instagram stories
              or posts, videography, and photography. I also contribute to a
              student association in the Marketing team, where I mostly focus on
              social media platfoms.

            <h3>UX/UI designer</h3>
            <p>
              From designing fun and gamified apps to visualizing data in
              complex software, I have had experience in creating various
              interfaces for different users. Combining the study of user
              behavior with creative design, I bring ideas to life in awesome
              projects.

            <h3>Web developer</h3>
            <p>
              To me, coding is fun when I can visually see what is changing on
              the screen. That's why I stuck with front-end development and
              built a couple of projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React,
              Node.js and Express.js etc.
